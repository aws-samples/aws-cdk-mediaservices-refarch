  gopSize: 1
  # Optionally gopSize can be overriden in individual renditions.
  # Overriding the gopSize in renditions only makes sense if renditions are using
  # a mix of framerates (say 25/50 or 30/60) and the gopSizeUnits is FRAMES.
  # Note: MediaLive requires all renditions to have the same length of a GOP in
  # seconds. For example, setting the GOP to 112 frames on a 50 fps rendition results
  # in a 2.24 second (112/50) GOP. For a 25 fps rendition in the same MediaLive Channel
  # the GOP would need to be set to 56 frames to get the same 2.24s GOP (i.e. 56/25).
